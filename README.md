# Web Chatting Application

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

This project is a **real-time web-based chatting application** built with **React.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Socket.IO**. It provides a responsive and user-friendly platform for real-time communication.

## Features

- **Real-Time Messaging:** Powered by Socket.IO for instant communication.
- **Responsive UI:** Built with Tailwind CSS for a clean, responsive design that works on all devices.
- **React Architecture:** Leverages React's component-based architecture for efficient rendering and state management.
- **Easy Setup:** Simple to install, configure, and run locally.


## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js (for server-side Socket.IO setup)
- **Real-Time Communication:** Socket.IO
- **Package Management:** npm (or yarn)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- npm or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chat-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd chat-app
   ```

3. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   or if you use yarn:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

### Running the Application

To run the app locally:

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   or with yarn:
   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

2. The app should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Backend Setup

If you're using a Node.js backend for Socket.IO:

1. Navigate to the `server` directory:
   ```bash
   cd server
   ```

2. Install the server dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the server:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

This will start the backend server for handling real-time messaging via Socket.IO.
